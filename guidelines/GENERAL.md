### Dead Code / Commented Code
Before submitting a PR make sure all the commented or unused code/class is removed or state on the comment why it must not be removed.

## GitHub
* Create one PR per bugfix or feature
* Base all PRs on the master branch unless stated otherwise
* Try pushing your code to GitHub at least daily

## Tests
* Create a new test for each feature
* Make sure to cover 100% of the class functionality
* When working on bugfixes/changes create missing tests for existing classes
* Create GitHub action to run test in windows and linux environments

## Naming Conventions
* If working on an existing project stick to the naming convention used throughout the app
* When creating new projects pick one naming convention and stick to it
