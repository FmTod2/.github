# Freelancer Requirements

## Overview

This low-priority project serves as an assessment phase before potentially engaging in a longer-term relationship with our team. The developed feature/module will be integrated into our main application for further testing.

## Requirements

### Pre-Engagement

- Project Estimate: You are responsible for setting the project deadline based on your own time estimate for completion, including test and QA phases.
- Clarifying Questions: Prepare a list of questions about any unclear aspects of the project guidelines.
- Skill Assessment: Clearly identify areas of expertise and areas where you might struggle.

### Development

- Technology Stack: The project must be developed using TypeScript, and it should include Test Cases and Documentation.
- Coding Style: The code should be clean, well-commented, and adhere to our coding standards.
- UI Requirements: The UI should use script setup and Composition API, and must also utilize the MDB4 package.
- Error Handling: Share your approach for solving bugs and errors.
- Improvement Suggestions: Feel free to offer recommendations for project enhancements.
- Quality Assurance: Conduct QA on your code to ensure it is free from bugs and meets specification.

### Communication

- Daily Updates: Provide daily updates on Slack regarding planned work for the day and accomplishments by end of day.
- Immediate Notifications: Alert us immediately in case of any coding or implementation issues and outline steps for resolution.
- Time Estimates: Give estimated time frames for each task or problem you're working on.

### Code Management

- GitHub: Push your code daily to GitHub, whether the task is completed or not.
- Integration: Ensure that the feature/module is fully functional and can be seamlessly integrated into the main app.

### Financial and Time Off

- Payment Terms: No payment will be made before the project is fully completed, tested, and passed QA. Upon successful completion, it may take us between 1 week to 1 month to implement the code into the main app and conduct further testing. Full payment will be released only when the feature/module passes all tests within the main app. If the implementation and testing phase on our end exceeds 1 month, a partial payment may be disbursed, with the balance to be paid upon successful implementation and testing in the main app.
- Availability: Notify us well in advance about any planned vacations or days off.

### Legal

- NDA Requirement: The freelancer is required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before commencing work on the project.

### Bonus

- Initiative: Extra consideration will be given to freelancers who show initiative and proactivity in solving unexpected problems or suggesting valuable features.

### Collaboration and Teamwork

You will be working independently on this project. However, one of our senior developers will closely review all code you submit and will be available to answer your questions.
If necessary, you must be willing to work closely with our in-house team members or other freelancers.

### Revision and Feedback

- Revisions: Should be open to receiving and acting upon constructive feedback to revise and improve the project.

### Compliance and Security

### Performance Review

- Post-Project Evaluation: Willingness to participate in a post-project review to evaluate what went well and what could be improved for future collaborations.

### Deadlines and Milestones

- The deadline for this project is based on the time estimate you provide for completing the task, including testing and QA. Your estimated time will serve as your deadline. Additionally, the project manager assigned to you also has an estimated time frame for this project and will notify you if your estimate exceeds the time frame they have set. Failure to meet these interim dates may result in project reassessment or termination.

### Conflict Resolution

- Conflict Resolution: In the event of disagreements or disputes, the matter will be escalated to MyListerHub Inc. Final decisions regarding project scope, deliverables, or quality will rest solely with us. Failure to comply with these terms could lead to termination of the project without payment.

By agreeing to these terms, you are acknowledging that successful completion and demonstration of competencies in this initial project may lead to further projects or an invitation to join our main app development team.
